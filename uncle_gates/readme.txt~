# NCL Gates Functional Simulation using NC-Verilog
# Instructions
##############################################################################

Change Dirctory to your target directory.
$tar xzvf uncle_gates.tar

$tcsh
$set_eda_env
$set_28nm_env

$./run.sh

This script will execute NC-Verilog automatically.

Select "tb_uncle_gates" on the Design Browser and selet all signals what you want to see on the Waveform window.

Click on right mouse button and select "Set to Target" => "Waveform Window".

It will open Waveform window.

go to Console - Simvision
and type run 100us
nc_sim>run 100us

The NC-Verilog simulation will be executed and output.txt file will be generated on your project directory.
Waveform window will show you all the waveforms.
The test result will be displayed on your Simvision console window(Pass/Fail).

The output.txt file will show you the input condition and output result and comparement between reference (using behavioral Verilog code) and Schematic design netlist(which is generated by Cadence Virtuoso Composer Schematic Editor).

==============================================

At the moment th33r gate is selected for the simulation but you can change the target Gates from the test-bench code (tb_uncle_gates.v).

The simulation has 6 differet input cases using 4 different stimulus input files.
(ncl_stimul_1input.txt, ncl_stimul_2input.txt, ncl_stimul_3input.txt, ncl_stimul_4input.txt)
Each input files generated by hand typing after considering monotonic input requirements of NCL gates.

You have to select INPUT_PORTS and RESET_PORT from the test-bench parameters and then select target Gate and modify their instantiation.

At the moment, we have to modify the test-bench file to change target Gates but will try to change this as an input option command without changing Verilog test-bench using script language.
