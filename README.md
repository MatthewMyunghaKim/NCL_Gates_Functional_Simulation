NCL_Gates_Functional_Simulation
===============================

Null Convention Logic Gates - Functional Simulation Testbenc Code using NC-Verilog

This design NCL_Gates_Functional_Simulation is designed by Matthew Myungha Kim.
I designed this for my University Research purpose.

This design is for the Null Convention Logic (NCL) Sates simulation using NC-Veriog of Cadence.
This design is including Verilog testbench files and Stimulus input files.
